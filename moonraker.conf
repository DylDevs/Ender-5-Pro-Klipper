# [power device_name]
# type: klipper_device
# #   The type of device.  Can be either gpio, klipper_device, rf,
# #   tplink_smartplug, tasmota, shelly, homeseer, homeassistant, loxonev1,
# #   smartthings, mqtt or hue.
# #   This parameter must be provided.
# off_when_shutdown: False
# #   If set to True the device will be powered off when Klipper enters
# #   the "shutdown" state.  This option applies to all device types.
# #   The default is False.
# on_when_job_queued: False
# #   If set to True the device will power on if a job is queued while the
# #   device is off.  This allows for an automated "upload, power on, and
# #   print" approach directly from the slicer, see the configuration example
# #   below for details. The default is False.
# locked_while_printing: False
# #   If True, locks the device so that the power cannot be changed while the
# #   printer is printing. This is useful to avert an accidental shutdown to
# #   the printer's power.  The default is False.
# restart_klipper_when_powered: False
# #   If set to True, Moonraker will schedule a "FIRMWARE_RESTART" to command
# #   after the device has been powered on. If it isn't possible to immediately
# #   schedule a firmware restart (ie: Klippy is disconnected), the restart
# #   will be postponed until Klippy reconnects and reports that startup is
# #   complete.  Prior to scheduling the restart command the power device will
# #   always check Klippy's state.  If Klippy reports that it is "ready", the
# #   FIRMWARE_RESTART will be aborted as unnecessary.
# #   The default is False.
# bound_service:
# #   Can be set to any service Moonraker is authorized to manage with the
# #   exception of the moonraker service itself. See the tip below this section
# #   for details on what services are authorized.  When a bound service has
# #   been set the service will be started when the device powers on and stopped
# #   when the device powers off.  The default is no service is bound to the
# #   device.
